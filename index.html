                                I will grow, learn more, enhance my skills and knowledge in the field of IT. As an employee,
                                I am able to meet the deadlines for the tasks that are assigned to me, I am flexible, very much
                                willing to learn, can work under pressure, can help and guide my colleagues while I'm doing my task,
                                fast-learner and I have the "can do" attitude. I can work with a minimal supervision and most of all,
                                I can adapt to the working environment I am working with.
